# Native Maps SDKs: Utility Network

The Native Maps SDKs empower developers to add map visualization and geospatial capabilities to mobile apps. In this session, we'll discuss how these SDKs can be used to build solutions for the utility industry, including electric, gas, water, and telco. You’ll learn how SDK capabilities enable developers to build location-aware applications for data discovery, collection, and analysis, both online and offline. In addition, we’ll demonstrate current support for utility networks, and utility-oriented features and workflows.

## Demos

Demos were built using [ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/) but the concepts apply to the Qt, Swift, and Kotlin Maps SDKs. Also used open-source [calcite-dotnet-toolkit](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-dotnet-toolkit) to style the .NET Maui and WPF applications.

Replace portal and runtime access information like `HOSTNAME`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `LICENSEKEY`, and `ADVANCEDEDITINGEXTENSIONKEY` with your own.
